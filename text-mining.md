## Text Mining
Text mining is a specialized stream of data mining, aimed at finding patterns, and hence unknown information, from chunks of digitized natural language.

Stemming from the field of computational linguistics, The goal of text mining is not just to extract information and show trends in data of text artifacts, but to actually make connections between different ideas; forming new knowledge in the same way that a human researcher would.

Unlike traditional information retrieval where users search for existing knowledge, text mining discovers previously unknown insights by automatically analyzing large volumes of unstructured text [^hearst2003]. Text mining encompasses several techniques including information extraction, categorization, clustering, summarization, and visualization [^gaikwad2014]. These methods enable the processing of large-scale text data that would be impossible to analyze manually, crucial for knowledge discovery in today's information-saturated digital landscape.

In new media contexts, text mining serves as a bridge between human-created content and computational understanding. It allows for the extraction of value and information from the growing corpus of digital text; which includes social media posts, news articles, academic publications, and user-generated content. This computational understanding, can then be used for numerous applications, like advertising, education and creative interpretation.

The concept of text mining became prominent through the work of Marti Hearst, who distinguished "real" text mining (discovering heretofore unknown information) from mere text analysis [^hearst2003]. Recent advancements in natural language processing, particularly through deep learning and LLM (GPT), have significantly enhanced text mining capabilities, enabling better semantic understanding and knowledge extraction [^devlin2019].

Despite significant progress, there remains challenges in the development of text mining practices. This is due to the simple fact that human language is incredibly nuanced, and difficult to fully understand, even as a human. For machines, contextual cues like sarcasm, irony, humour, or other general nuances can be incredibly difficult to pinpoint, resulting in inconsistent 'understandings'.

As we move further into the future, text mining will remain ultra-relevant, especially in the fields of AI, data surveillance and education/research. It is important to responsibly devlop these technolgies so that they do not cause unintentional harm, and instead benefit our collective way of knowing.
